# Scripts for PilotSSH

This repository holds scripts usable with the PilotSSH application, available on [iOS][insert link] and soon on Android. This application provides an easy way to manage a server, through a set of scripts stored on the server, used to generate a convenient user interface on your smartphone.

To use a new script, upload its folder to **~/.pilotssh** on your server, and you are ready to go!
